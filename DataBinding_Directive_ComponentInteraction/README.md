# Todo App

## Two-way data binding
* Two-way binding gives components in your application a way to share data. Use two-way binding binding to listen for events and update values simultaneously between parent and child components.

## Angular directives
* At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

##  Component interaction using @Input, @Output and EventEmitter
