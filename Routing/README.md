# Angular routing

* To handle the navigation from one view to the next,the Angular Router is used. 
* The Router enables navigation by interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to change the view.
* It enables developers to build Single Page Applications with multiple views and allow navigation between these views.
* The Router-Outlet is a directive that’s available from the router library where the Router inserts the component that gets matched based on the current browser’s URL.
