# Angular Template Driven 

* Template-driven forms rely on directives in the template to create and manipulate the underlying object model. 
* They are useful for adding a simple form to an app, such as an email list signup form. 
* They're easy to add to an app, but they don't scale as well as reactive forms. 
* If you have very basic form requirements and logic that can be managed solely in the template, template-driven forms could be a good fit.
